# TIL
My collection of thoughts and notes to small things that I learn and feel like remembering for later, could be short thoughts or even long notes on something I read or watched.

##About
This wonderful idea was stolen from [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til/blob/master/README.md), who stole it from [thoughtbot/til](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til), and was probably stolen many other times. Thanks!
